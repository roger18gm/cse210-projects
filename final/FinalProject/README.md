This application is meant to emulate an online banking service where a guest
is prompted with menu of options. The guest user will then have to open a
bank account and create login credentials. Afterwards they will have full access
to add an additional checking/savings account, view their account balance(s), transfer funds to another user account, or log out. Returning users can simply
log in with their user credentials and utilize the same features. 

Two user files are provided with this application for testing of JSON serialization and unserialization.
